How to generate "hys2xml.exe" under Windows.
----------------------------------------------

1, Download and install cygwin:

	http://www.cygwin.com/

and make sure you also install with the package "make", "flex", and "gcc" utilities.

2, Download "bison-1.875" from
	
	http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/bison-1.875.tar.gz

and install from source:
	- unpack and enter the directory
	
		tar xvzf bison-1.875.tar.gz
		cd bison-1.875
	
	- install using "1.875" suffix

		./configure --program-suffix=-1.875
		make
		make install

3, Edit the "Makefile" and uncomment the following line:

	YACC = BISON_PKGDATADIR=`pwd` `which bison-1.875`

and rewrite 
	
	XFLAGS = -mno-cygwin

4, You can now compile the source files by typing

	make

at the prompt. Optionally, the same result can be achieved by "make XFLAGS='-mno-cygwin'"
command. DO NOT ADD '-mwindows' flag because the resulting executable will hang out when
executed from MATLAB. Resulted executable "hys2xml.exe" has worked fine under both windows 32bit 
64 bit versions. Moreover, "hys2xml.exe" generated under win32 has worked under win64 and vice-versa. 

5, Start Matlab and enter the directory "hysde3/@xmltree/private" 

On windows 32bit:
mex sub_allchildren.c
mex xml_cell_find.c
mex xml_findstr.c

On windows 64 bit:
mex -largeArrayDims sub_allchildren.c
mex -largeArrayDims xml_cell_find.c
mex -largeArrayDims xml_findstr.c

The flag "-largeArrayDims" will be default in future versions of Matlab.



PROBLEMS:

In case that something goes wrong, you may consider downloading the latest package of "yaxx"

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/yaxx/

Unpack the package and go to, e.g. "yaxx-0.12/yaxx/bison/data" directory. Here you find many
skeleton files that begin with "yaxx-" prefix. You may try to replace the file "yaxx.c" in 
"hysdel3/hys2xml" with some of the new skeleton file, depending on which version of bison you have.
Do not forget to backup the old "yaxx.c" file, as not every skeleton file can be usable.
